# 🎯 Problem: Valid Perfect Square

## 🧒 Let’s Imagine:
You have a number, like 16, and you want to know:
👉 "Can I get this number by multiplying some whole number by itself?"

Example:
- 4 × 4 = 16 ✅ (Yes! It's a perfect square!)
- But 3 × 3 = 9 ❌ and 5 × 5 = 25 ❌ (So 14 is not a perfect square)

## 🚫 But Wait...
We are **NOT allowed** to use a calculator or the `sqrt()` function to cheat 😅  
We must figure it out with **logic**!

## 🧠 Smart Way (Binary Search):
We check between 1 and the number itself.

1. We try the middle number
2. Square it
3. If it's too small, we try bigger numbers
4. If it's too big, we try smaller ones
5. If we hit the exact number = 🎉 Perfect square!

## 💻 Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def isPerfectSquare(self, num: int) -> bool:
        left, right = 1, num
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            square = mid * mid
            if square == num:
                return True
            elif square < num:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return False
🎓 What We Learned:
A perfect square is just a number made by multiplying a number with itself

We can find it smartly using binary search

No calculator needed, just logic! 💡

🌟 Example:
Input: 16 → Output: True (Because 4 × 4 = 16)

Input: 14 → Output: False (No number times itself gives 14)
